Pokémon3D Game Open Source

Have a look at the wiki for more information about the architecture of the game.

Currently, windows is the only offical supported platform. By using monogame, we may port this game later to linux and Mac OS.
 
 ## System Requirements
 
- Windows 7 or higher
- Graphics Card with DirectX 11 SM 5.0 Support 

## How to support this game

We look forward for helping with the game using PR requests. We have a focus on keeping the architecture clean, but are open minded for improvements. 

Please not this is a side project done in free time, so there is maybe no continuous progress.
